## ‚ú® The Story

**Sway of Life** is a four-part experimental animation series that tells a profound, wordless story. It follows a single dandelion seed as it travels through different environments, each episode serving as a meditation on a core theme of life:

- **Episode 1: From the Valley** | *Letting Go*
- **Episode 2: From the Lake** | *The Unexpected*
- **Episode 3: From the City** | *Desire and Contentment*
- **Episode 4: To Home** | *Sacrifice and Rebirth*

The narrative is conveyed purely through visuals, sound design, and symbolic imagery, aiming to be both a calming and thought-provoking experience.

## Creative Vision

This project is an exercise in visual storytelling and minimalist design. The goal is to evoke emotion and reflection without a single word, using:
- **Subtle animation** and soft, natural lighting.
- A muted, but powerful color palette that shifts with each episode.
- **Dynamic soundscapes** that define the world and the seed's journey.
